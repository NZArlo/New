**“What got you here won't get you there”**, is a mantra many organisations live by and is no different today than when Marshall Goldsmith coined it in 2008. In the same way that professionals need to reflect on themselves and embrace change, it must also be relevant at an organisational level. 

[Qual IT](https://www.qualit.co.nz) has a successful track record over the last 15 years embracing change from initially specialising in testing services to now broadening to provide independent and integrated Quality Assurance. They have responded to organisations understanding the risks within IT projects, which come from more than just technology alone. Inherent risks also come from ineffective governance, project delivery approach and management of staff and vendors – which builds into our normal sphere of People, Process and Technology. Furthermore, the impact of business risk to processes and people, whilst often given lip service, are rarely considered seriously.

[Qual IT](https://www.qualit.co.nz) has seen the absence of attention on business risk time and time again working with clients on digital transformations of all shapes and sizes. Traditional approaches to managing business risk often comprised of communicating changes at a high-level, missing any detail of actual impact to people and processes, as well as linking and tracking back to the benefits justified from the business case.  ß
