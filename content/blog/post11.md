After a very recent engagement we were reviewing results, and started discussing similarities between an asset and human resource management, with interesting insights.

## Current Stigma
In the “modern” age of working in an agile manner, focusing on human potential and collaboration, we still refer to people as resources. 
“Resources”, a single category for everything that can fit onto a spreadsheet, people included. By pure coincidence, the row number in the spreadsheet can easily serve as an Employee ID as well.
And yet organisation still struggle daily with employee satisfaction, training, collaboration and retention.

## Challenges
By referring to a person as a resource, the following attributes are immediately implied:
It is identified by a number
It is bought and is disposable

Any company that articulates this during an interview, would have zero hires. Unfortunately, this typically only surfaces after the honeymoon period.
People-focused initiatives such as training, wellbeing, voice-of-the-employee typically take a backseat when faced with bureaucracy.
 
## Comparison with Asset Maintenance
To put these challenges into context, let’s consider the same approach when purchasing an asset, for example, a car.

| Budget | The rational approach before buying a car is to check if you can afford it. But there is more than just the purchase price, there is also fuel, tires, maintenance and care. All of these items total a substantial investment, for something that has a defined end of life. |
|:--|:--|
| Maintenance | During the lifetime of the car often used or not, certain things need to be done regularly. These include changing tires, getting serviced and washed. It is abundantly clear that we dedicate a lot of time and “resources” to making sure the car is in top form. |


----------------------------------------


Relating this to how we deal with employees, it is not uncommon to experience something different.

During our tenure at a company, we very often experience the need/desire to acquire additional skills. If the skills in questions are needed in the company, it classifies as “building” and “maintaining” the person, increasing their value. This increased value is not only beneficial to the company, but also the person, their well-being and their career.
The argument for not approving on the training is usually:
There is no time available
There is no money available

The question around money is that there should be a budget allocated to each person to receive training according to their career. Similar to planning the total cost of ownership when buying a car. Without proper training and improvement, the efficiency and effectiveness of the person reduces, resulting in work taking longer.
Perhaps there is a concern that they might leave after acquiring all the additional knowledge. That is a valid question to ask, but what if you did not invest in the training, and they stay?

The same approach is true when considering the tools, systems, processes the people in your company uses. Not measuring, reviewing and improving these, will result in a substantial waste of time, money and human potential.

## Future State
> Focus on the humans, not the resources - Simon Sinek

By giving more attention to the people and the way they work, there will be a clear improvement to:
* Collaboration and trust
* Morale and focus
* Confidence to deliver
* Increased loyalty
For the company, the results will be:
* Delivering better value to customers
* Innovation and ideas
* Brand reputation
* Better solutions
* Reduced time management

Each person in the company will feel the effect of proper development plans, measuring the flow of work and lead times. By improving lead times, customers receive value sooner, cheaper and with less waste along the way.

With this type of environment, the need to manage everyone's time would become obsolete:
Timesheets
Time and motion studies

## Next Steps
Some of the items are relatively straightforward to implement, for example, budgets and development plans and should be done.
To identify challenges and constraints in the daily work performed by people is a lot more difficult. Not because the knowledge is not in-house, but rather that there is no time to do the necessary work, or to establish the end-to-end visibility and gather metrics.

This end-to-end optimisation focus is where the value of Lean, Agile and DevOps truly shines. These are not technical practices purely based on automation, but rather ways of working to ensure the survival and dominance of companies.

## Conclusion
All of the practices and patterns in the current world of knowledge work is focused on people. And it is ironic that we ever had the idea that it was something different, as no company would exist without the people. It is the people that make the company, not the assets and not the resources.

But let’s focus on building our employees, and remove the obstacles they face while building your company.
