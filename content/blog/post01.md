Organisations wanting to fulfil customer needs faster and better, need to shift their focus. Many organisations spend too much time naval gazing their internal operating model and lose focus on the customer. A large number of process improvement and technology projects fail to deliver benefits simply because they focus on solving tactical issues. Instead, significant benefits can been gained from focusing efforts on how processes and technology can add value to the customer.

Highly efficient organisations understand their entire value chain, working backwards from customer requirement to fulfilment, not the other way around. The focus on optimising the value chain has seen the re-birth of Lean in organisations as a mechanism for motivating a culture for improvements. In saying that, Lean never really went away as the principles have been the basis of many other frameworks such as Agile and DevOps.

The key principles of Lean, as best described by James Womack's famous ‘Lean Thinking’ (1996), still hold true today and should continue to govern the way organisations deliver customer value. They are:

*   Define value – What value can you deliver to your customer?
*   Map value stream – How can you better deliver value to your customer?
*   Create flow – What frictionless ways can your processes enhance your customer experience?
*   Establish pull – How can you manage your fulfilment based on your customer demand?
*   Pursuit perfection – How can your processes enable you to deliver right the first time?
        
Focusing on making your business more efficient to the customer simply makes good business sense. A seamless and effortless experience for your customer amongst other things:
        
*   Raises customer repurchases to 94% (Gartner - ‘Three Bold Strategies for Customer Experience Victory’ - 2019)
*   Increases customer spend/share of wallet to 88% (Gartner - ‘Three Bold Strategies for Customer Experience Victory’ - 2019)
*   Increase employee productivity by 44% (IDC - IDC Workplace Transformation Study - 2019)

The key challenges with many process improvement initiatives is making the approach seamless and the change stick. The very nature of removing manual effort in processes is also a flaw of how traditional Lean is applied in organisations. Documenting and analysing current and future state of value streams and processes manually creates as much inefficiencies and cost to your business as those processes themselves.

What if there was a software that could be used to map and capture data on your processes, then perform the Lean analysis to surface 'waste' automatically? 

Also, what if by having your process information easily accessible on the cloud, you could share, collaborate, and encourage a culture of continuous improvement among stakeholders?
