The EU [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) went into effect on May 25, 2018. Boxfish is ready.

***************************************************

**Does GDPR affect me?**

If you're based in the EU or do business in the EU, yeah! GDPR has a long reach. If you have [any EU personal data in your Boxfish account](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/), such as names, email addresses, ID numbers, or… anything personally identifiable, then GDPR applies. You are a Controller of personal data under GDPR, so you need to enter into GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with any online services and third party vendors you rely on, including Boxfish. These agreements are commonly called a Data Processing Addendum, or DPA.

***************************************************

**Data Processing Addendum**

Contracts required! Processing EU personal data must be governed by a [GDPR-compliant contract](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/). We provide a standard Data Processing Addendum (DPA) to extend GDPR privacy principles, rights, and obligations everywhere personal data is processed.

✍️ Sign the DPA online here.

Boxfish participates in the [EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework](https://www.boxfish.global/privacyshield) to safeguard the transfer of personal data to the US, meeting the GDPR requirement for adequate data protection laws.

***************************************************

**Subprocessors**

Boxfish uses third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to provide our services. We enter into GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, and require the same of them. List of [Boxfish subprocessors](https://www.boxfish.global/thirparty).
