**We protect your data**
All data is written to the Cloud instantly, backed up daily, and stored in our Cloud hosting environment.

***************************************************

**Your data is sent using HTTPS**
Whenever your data is in transit between you and us, everything is encrypted, and sent using HTTPS. Any files which you upload to us are stored and are encrypted at rest. Data isn't encrypted at rest â€” they are active in our database. Our backups of your data are encrypted using TLS.

***************************************************

**Regularly-updated infrastructure**
Our software infrastructure is updated regularly with the latest security patches. Our products run on a dedicated network which is locked down with firewalls and carefully monitored. While perfect security is a moving target, we work with security researchers to keep up with the state-of-the-art in web security.

***************************************************

**Experienced founders**
Our founders have collectively 40 years of IT experience. Security isn't just about technology, it's about trust they have earned from working with customers and understanding the importance of keeping your information safe. They'll continue to work hard every day to maintain that trust. Longevity and stability is core to our mission at Boxfish.
